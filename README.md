# OSU Baseball Pitching Machine Feeder Project by SPD
This code is part of a project done by the Sports Product Development Club at Oregon State University for the OSU Baseball team. The project is to add an attachment to a baseball pitching machine to allow multiple baseballs to be loaded ahead of time so that players can pracitice hitting without a coach. The goal of this code is to implement:
- moving a stepper motor which triggers one baseball to fall
- allowing the player to adjust the timing between pitches by turning a potentiometer
- turning on our stepper device by pressing a button on the machine or a remote control button
- turning on a light indicator if the device is active
- displaying a light animation to indicate timing of the pitch
